## 🧠 System Overview

`krunaln` is a production-oriented engineer with 7+ years of experience
designing and shipping scalable backend systems and AI-powered platforms.

I focus on:
- Designing systems before writing code
- Making trade-offs explicit
- Building boring, reliable cores that survive production

## 🔧 Loaded Capabilities

- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript
- **Datastores**: PostgreSQL, pgvector
- **Architectures**: Event-driven, queue-based, agent-oriented
- **AI Systems**: RAG, hybrid search, multi-agent orchestration
- **Domains**: Learning platforms, recommender systems, developer tooling

## 🏗 Active Deployments

### 🛒 MACRS — Multi-Agent Conversational Recommender
- Research-aligned multi-agent system
- Planner + Reflection loop + RAG
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense vectors)
- Focus on correctness, orchestration, and evaluation

---

### 🔥 AI Roast Reply GIF Generator
*A deliberately constrained system — no APIs, no LLMs, no external services.*

- Deterministic server-side GIF generation
- Chat-style UI rendered purely as pixels
- Designed to be embedded directly into a README
- Zero runtime dependencies on AI services

**Live Embed (yes, this is generated server-side):**

Why this project exists:
- To prove that creativity doesn’t require abstraction bloat
- To explore deterministic rendering under strict constraints
- Because good engineering can still be fun

---

## ⚙ Engineering Principles

- Design > Code
- Determinism over magic
- Observability first
- Scale is a feature, not an afterthought

---

## 🚀 Runtime Status

Currently exploring:
- Agent evaluation frameworks
- Scalable RAG architectures
- Long-running workflows and orchestration
